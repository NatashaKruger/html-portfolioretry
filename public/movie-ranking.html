<h1>The Best Movies According to Natasha</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

        <h3>Grease</h3>
            <p>Grease is my all time favorite as it combines a soppy love story with some amazing music.</p>
        <h3>Thelma the Unicorn</h3>
            <p>This movie is a favorite for my daughter, she will watch it over and over again.  How a little horse turned into a unicorn and became all she ever wanted to be, and at the end she realised being herself was all that she indeed needed.</p>
        <h3>Cinderella Story</h3>
            <p>This movie is the ultimate love story, it reflects a lot of emotions throughtout the story that indicated how mean kids can be, but despite it all, the end turns out better than expected.</p>
